### Hello

#right
### Hi there, nice to meet you

Allow me to introduce myself, Valerie Vernaillen, pleased to meet you. I’m a passionate events –and marketingchick that is always looking for a new challenge. I don’t fear something new or unknown that is coming ahead, so let’s go for it.

I’m not afraid of a heavy working week and don’t have a nine-to-five-mentality. As a teamplayer I love working with my colleagues to achieve a common goal but except from that, I also feel good doing my thing solo. Just put me at my desk so I can kickstart my project with a full focus. Deadlines & work on the field are what keeps me going.

On this website I’ll give you a better view on my professional and personal  life of the last few years. I hope it will grab your attention and  bring us to the next chapter. I’m always in for a chat so don’t hesitate to contact me or send me an email.
