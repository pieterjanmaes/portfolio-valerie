A project I have lost my heart to.... World Chocolate Masters. To this day, I have been working as the all-round project manager of this project, setting up this wonderful production from A to Z. WCM is a brand in itself, a label of quality, a source of inspiration and above all a bringer of talent. World Chocolate Masters is a place where trends are born and where boundaries are explored in abundance. As lead in this project, I am in intense contact with the various stakeholders of the event. On the one hand, I consult the internal committee and external consultants to shape the project, and on the other, I inform and engage the 20 or so local marketing and academy teams involved.

I take care of the day-to-day continuation and coordinate an external agency to take care of communications for this purpose. Together with our internal digital teams, we developed a digital strategy that is now being rolled out further. The tasks below are also part of my responsibilities:
