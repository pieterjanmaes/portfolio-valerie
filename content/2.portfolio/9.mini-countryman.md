You used to have the Mini, now there are Minis of all shapes and sizes. And that the hippest of car makers has even more wild plans for the coming years was evident from the presentation that kicked off the Mini Dealer Convention at the end of October. It brought dealers, salespeople and their life partners to Antwerp, a city where this lovable car is very much in its element.

During the corporate presentation, by the way, the ladies enjoyed a guided fashion tour of Antwerp Fashion City. And what was so wild a few years ago is today a reality: the Mini Countryman. The latest version of this adventurous Mini was extensively highlighted in the evening at the Felix Pakhuis in its own mobile setting, which will tour the country in the coming months. For the occasion, that rugged outdoor setting also served as an atmospheric setting for a (walking) dinner and (dancing) party, which had all the invites feasting and swinging. Jolly good job, Fast Forward!
