After the WCM Bootcamp in Barcelona, the months ahead are more important than anything. To define ideas, find sparring partners, discuss hot topics, ... Even if this competition is based on individual performance, we are a community, always open to new ideas.

For 3 days, they immersed themselves in a series of inspirational sessions on artistry, design, craft and taste: a unique opportunity to collaborate, exchange and gain new insights right before the final.

In this event I did not only act as project manager from an 'event' perspective but I also took the word as a presenter towards the World Chocolate Masters finalists. I tried to prepare them as good as possible for the wave that was coming towards them in Paris later that year. A wave of stress, time running out and constant pressure. Driving them through the practicals & having in depth conversations was the way to success.
