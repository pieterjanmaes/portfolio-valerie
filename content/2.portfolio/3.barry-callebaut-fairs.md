A fair with international appeal and an important audience, Sirha Lyon! For this fair, in my role as fairs & events coordinator, I worked with the local French team to create an exhibition stand and experience perfectly in line with brand evolutions and industry trends. From puzzling with the architect to realise the ideal layout within the stand, to the graphic work with the right CTA's to put our brands in the spotlight. All these follow-ups I took care of to fully support the local team. Integrating an interactive VR experience really puts our brands on the map. We organise these kinds of experiences to send customers home with a story that will stay with them for a long time. As the F&E coordinator, I was always responsible for getting the right brand messages communicated correctly. I am most in my element when I am sitting around the table brainstorming about this or hands-on on the stand seeing my ideas become reality.
