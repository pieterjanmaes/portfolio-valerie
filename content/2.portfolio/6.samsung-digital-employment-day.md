The Samsung Digital Employment Day on 23 October marked the start of Media Innovation Week, an initiative of Ghent University, in collaboration with Samsung. Fast Forward organised the kickoff in the University's magisterial auditorium in Volderstraat.

Throughout the morning there were lectures and debates by interesting speakers such as Alexander De Croo, Sangwoo Kim (Samsung Electronics Europe), Erik Manners and Jeroen Lemaire, led and moderated by host Wim De Vilder.

Was there perhaps a job to pick up? You never know. In between, there was time for a chat with Samsung representatives, so ambitious students could grab their chance. Media Innovation Week ended in beauty a few days later with Samsung Innovation Seminar. Le moment suprÃªme for some students. Were their ideas Samsung-worthy? Samsung's promise was no mean feat: 'Whoever presents us with the best innovative idea will have a chance to win a job'. Moreover, to top it all off, Samsung also gave away a Note 8 smartphone as well as a trip to New York. If that's not a great ending.
