Music For Life. Again, there was no escaping the end-of-year period. And just as well. Because as long as people are committed to good causes, there is hope. But how does a person actually choose their favourite charity from a labyrinth of 1000+ non-profit organisations?

Simple. By making their way through Het Goede Doelhof - a maze constructed entirely of wooden pallets - visitors to De Schorre could use the colours to find the one organisation they wanted to make a donation to. As a centrepiece, builder Studio Brussel and contractor Fast Forward provided a watchtower that offered a magnificent view over the recreation area in Boom, lit with human warmth and good music.
