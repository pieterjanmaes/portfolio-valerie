For this year's Carglass Roadshow, the annual event for some 450 Carglassers, was organised at the Insight TV studios in Londerzeel where the venue was given a full space age d√©cor.

The invites got to work with VR and the entertainment was not exactly vintage either: an LED violinist, an act with iPads, a quiz woven into the presentations,... to end with a completely analogue walking dinner. The Carglass Roadshow was/is the prototype of a successful corporate event anno 2016, courtesy of Fast Forward.
