Bad luck? Not for visitors to the motor show, as VAB was already on site. Fast Forward provided a topper of a stand in palace 4.

Visitors to the VAB stand got more than just information. They could have fun by racing little bikes against each other. With a present as a prize for the winner of the game. Those who are members of VAB can count on stress relief not only in the event of car breakdowns, but also in the event of 'car trouble'. Because members could catch their breath during the fair with a free drink in the cosy club lounge. A nice gift that could count on a lot of appreciation.
